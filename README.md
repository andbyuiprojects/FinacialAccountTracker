# Overview

This software allows a user to create a financial account, with a desired Name, desired user ID, and a balance in the 
account. It then allows the user to be able to edit the account balance by adding or taking from the account. 
At any time the user can exit the program.

I wrote this software to be able to use it later to create an app to allow a person to keep track of their finances in 
a way that does not have a lot of fluff other apps have. I wanted a very streamline, to the point program.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

# Development Environment
To develop this program, I used the Intellij IDEA Community IDE to write the Kotlin language.

The library I used in this program was the java util scanner. This allowed me to be able to take any input from a user,
not just a string.

# Future Work
- Add better classes to allow for better functionality
- Add more functions to split up the work
- Add a collection of accounts to be able to store more than one account
